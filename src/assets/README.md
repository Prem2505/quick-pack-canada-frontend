# Logo Image

Please place your Quick Pack Canada logo file here with the filename `logo.png`.

If you use a different filename or format, update the import in `src/components/Navbar.jsx`:

```jsx
import logo from '../assets/images/your-logo-filename.ext'
```

**Recommended logo dimensions:**
- Height: approximately 50px (will be scaled automatically)
- Width: Auto (maintains aspect ratio)
